            <p>
                In the Requirements and Use Cases of the Web Audio API spec,
                outlined over a decade ago in 2013, the Audio Working Group
                described the possibility of creating a
                <a
                    href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio-usecases/#connected-dj-booth"
                    >connected DJ booth</a
                >
                application. The following DJ workflow is detailed:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    &hellip;the DJ would be able to quickly select several other
                    track [sic], play them through headphones without affecting
                    the main audio output of the application, and match them to
                    the track currently playing through a mix of pausing,
                    skipping forward or back and pitch/speed change.
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                This is (mostly<sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup
                >) possible now! Some parts of this application are relatively
                straightforward:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    manipulating <code>detune</code> and
                    <code>playbackRate</code> are sufficient for jogging a track
                    when beatmatching
                </li>
                <li>
                    targeting different audio destinations (e.g. &mdash;
                    headphones/line out) is possible via
                    <a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext/setSinkId"

                    there are several ways to pause a piece of audio<sup

                    >
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                But one crucial feature of a DJ application that is presently
                nontrivial to implement is the ability to
                <em>audibly rewind an audio track</em>. Audibly rewinding a
                track has two critically important functions for a DJ:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    while cueing, the DJ can precisely hear where a
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9Urjp95Odw"
                        >cuepoint will start</a
                    >
                    without needing to play a track forwards or consult a visual
                    representation of the audio. Having an accurate and fast way
                    to define cuepoints is essential for beatmatching as defined
                    in the spec's use case.
                </li>
                <li>
                    the DJ can perform a
                    <a
                        href="https://youtu.be/EFv-F71qLXQ?si=uiLAhxYlur-Gj9qE&t=18"
                        >spinback</a
                    >
                    of the track. In some genres of music, rewinding a track in
                    this way is
                    <a
                        href="https://medium.com/cuepoint/wheel-it-up-history-of-the-rewind-21fdcff243d9"
                        >an essential transition technique</a
                    >.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                The na&iuml;ve approach of setting a negative
                <code>playbackRate</code> is
                <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/playbackRate"
                    >only supported in some WebKit-based browsers</a
                >, so Chrome users &mdash; 65% of internet traffic &mdash; are
                out of luck.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fortunately, it is possible to implement audible rewind. Like
                most programming problems, this can be broken up into a set of
                smaller, simpler problems.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h3>High-level overview</h3>

            <p>
                This work abstracts out a bit more down the line to be an
                <code>AudioNode</code> that generally supports a negative
                <code>playbackRate</code>, but for right now we'll specifically
                work with our little DJ example.
            </p>

            <p>
                What we're essentially looking to create is an
                <code>AudioNode</code> that can generate the
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lra0087Rac"
                    >"era era era"</a
                >
                sound that is characteristic of DJing. We'll need to have a
                reversed version of our audio, and we'll want the ability to
                quickly swap between the forwards and reversed audio. When we
                swap between forwards and reversed audio, we'll want to be
                <em>very</em> precise about the start point of the audio that is
                being swapped in, so that we don't have any audio jank.
            </p>

            <p>This sets us up for four distinct tasks:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Reversing our forwards audio</li>
                <li>Accurately tracking playback position of audio</li>
                <li>Swapping between forwards and reversed audio</li>
                <li>Putting it all together</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>1. Reversing our forwards audio</h4>

            <p>
                Our easiest task is reversing our audio &mdash; of which there
                are a few different approaches:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>outside of the browser with <code>ffmpeg</code></li>
                <li>
                    inside our browser or web worker by reversing all channel
                    data on a decoded <code>AudioBuffer</code
                    ><sup><a href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                At a very high level, all digital audio just an array of
                floating point numbers. We just need to reverse this array.
            </p>

            <h4>2. Accurately tracking playback position of audio</h4>

            <p>
                There is not a great, built-in way to track the playback
                position of an <code>AudioBufferSourceNode</code>. For our DJ
                application, the typical minimal approach of using
                <code>audioContext.currentTime</code> to bookend when audio
                starts and stops would be too imprecise to prevent audio jank
                and may cause misalignment between our forwards and backwards
                audio tracks. Besides, detuning and adjusting
                <code>playbackRate</code> for beatmatching would mean we would
                have to perform precise math when calculating the amount of time
                played between these already imprecise bookends.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most of the more clever workarounds to this are problem, of
                course, in
                <a href="https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api/issues/2397"
                    >a random GitHub thread</a
                >. My favorite approach detailed
                <a
                    href="https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api/issues/2397#issuecomment-459514360"
                    >here</a
                >
                is to create an additional channel on the
                <code>AudioBuffer</code>, fill it with the percentage that a
                channel completed with 0 at the first index and 1 at the last
                index, and then read from it via an <code>AnalyserNode</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                To elaborate briefly on this, an <code>AudioBuffer</code> is
                composed of channels of <code>Float32Array</code> representing
                the amplitudes of an audio signal. There are no rules to what
                these <code>Float32Array</code>s can actually encode, assuming
                that the values we put in the array are finite 32-bit
                floating-point numbers. When we play digital audio, your
                computer traverses through this array of numbers and translates
                that into sound. If we have a silent, additional channel that
                represents playback percentage, we can figure out what this
                current playback percentage is at a given time by reading from
                this channel during playback.
            </p>

            <h4>3. Swapping between forwards and reversed audio</h4>

            <p>
                Swapping between forwards and backwards audio turns us back into
                the more straightforward world of good old state management.
                When our <code>playbackRate</code> is positive, we want our
                forward node to be playing. When we set our
                <code>playbackRate</code> to negative, we want our reverse node
                to be playing. Finally, when we swap between directions, we want
                to make sure that our nodes times are aligned. The playback
                position of the reverse node is the complement of the forward
                node, and vice versa &mdash; as an example: given a 10-second
                long audio clip, if we are exactly 4 seconds into forwards
                playback and we move into reverse,
                <em>we'll want to play the reverse audio from 6 seconds in</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
                To handle this swap, we'll override the
                <code>playbackRate</code> method of an <code>AudioNode</code>.
                When the amount is negative but our forwards node is currently
                playing (or vice versa), we swap in the active node with the
                complementary playback position of the inactive node and pause
                the inactive node.<sup><a href="#footnote-5">5</a></sup>
            </p>

            <p>
                Both nodes could be routed through a
                <code>ChannelMergerNode</code>, so our exposed interface may
                just be a single <code>AudioNode</code>.
            </p>

            <h4>4. Putting it all together</h4>

            <p>
                After wiring everything together, we're left with something like

                        Putting the
                        <code>playbackRate</code> in the negative will play the
                        drum track backwards.

                By mapping <code>playbackRate</code> to an interface
                representing a jog wheel or turntable, a user could rapidly
                toggle through a track and create that sweet "era era era"
                sound.
