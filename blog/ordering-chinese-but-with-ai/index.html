                Back around 2012-ish, I was a member of a medium-large Facebook
                group named simply <em>"ideas"</em>. In the group, posters wrote
                single sentence concepts and left them for other group members
                to consider. Ideas ranged from "a car powered by bong water and
                positive vibes" to "two Chief Keefs". You get the picture
                &mdash; just a bunch of guys fucking around. It was a great
                time.
            </p>

            <p>
                In software we strive for a mostly logical, causal relationship
                between what we're developing and what we're trying to solve
                for. What I mean is that we go out and talk to people, identify
                some unaddressed need, figure out if the market is viable,
                develop some kind of widget and then iterate against that until
                you can't iterate any more. That type of thing. Developers are
                conditioned into this structured way of thinking &mdash; every
                decision and LOC should be driven by some fundamental business
                or technical cause.
            </p>

            <p>
                And this is a good thing! Not a particularly profound assessment
                on my end. We should be working for some practical end most of
                the time &mdash; electricians, lawyers, and veterinarians all
                need software in the modern world and software developers need
                to put food on the table. There is also much beauty and purpose
                to be found in the world of utilitarian things, even in
                software. But I bring up that earlier point about the joy in
                having easy, half-baked ideas that go nowhere for a reason: I
                think, sometimes, simple bad ideas are good.<sup

            <p>
                Again, this is unfortunately not a particularly profound
                assessment on my end. UX people used to talk about "ideation"
                all the time, and about how the best way to have a good idea is
                to have a high volume of ideas while accepting that most of them
                will be bad.<sup><a href="#note2">2</a></sup> I think this is
                fair, but I also want to more specifically point two killer
                features of a bad idea:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Bad ideas are really mentally inexpensive to make. Just
                    think of the first, worst thing and roll with it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A bad idea has a built-in timebomb. Working on a bad idea
                    has the opposite of the feedback loop associated with a good
                    idea &mdash; you will receive no positive feedback, everyone
                    &mdash; including yourself &mdash; will question why you
                    would spend 5 more seconds on this idea, and a crushing
                    boredom will inevitably box you out. In the world of bad
                    ideas, you have to get in, hold your breath while you do
                    your thing, and get out. If you’re lucky, you learn
                    something.
                </li>
            </ol>

                >
                and it has been pretty easy this go-around trying to figure out
                what it is that the

                murky waters.

                When you're exploring a new technical domain, it can be tricky
                to figure out what to build beyond the TODO app, because, well,
                you have no idea what any of this technology can even do.<sup

                You get where this is going &mdash; let's roll with our first,

                Now I mean, in 2025 taking something that's been done to
                absolute death (food delivery) but also Now With AI™️ is
                borderline illegal or should be. But when exploring a new
                domain, being forced to think quickly, take as many shortcuts as
                possible, and get something <em>barely</em> working, the
                confines of an ill-fated venture lend you so much speed and
                structure. Enums causing some weird Prisma error on your client?
                Fuck it, covert them to strings. Taking a bit too much time to
                flesh out a service that can handle different providers? Just
                write that shit in the route handler. What's the worst that can
                happen? You don't have to
                <a
                    href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180228-00/?p=98125"

                And after about 3 days, I was at my absolute limit. I could not
                bear the thought of putting even one more keystroke towards this
                repo. But that's good! That's the built-in shutoff kicking in.
                This was a bad idea, so walking away has always been the
                smartest thing I could actually do. The repo, without a single
                fork or star, will unceremoniously decay in cyberspace. It is,
                at best, a cairn for Python AI/ML devs trying to figure out how
                to structure a TypeScript application repo. At its worst, it's
                still fodder for the very machines that power it.

                    Note that it's important to not conflate "bad ideas" with
                    "side projects", "unproven theories", or just "having
                    ideas". For our purposes, a "bad idea" is a specific variety
                    of side project that is not highly aligned with a
                    developer's personal interests, is not of notable technical
                    interest, and will not make you any sweet cash. You know
                    this all ahead of time. It should feel stupid 100% of the
                    time.

                    it is. Pour one out for Don Norman. That said, I'm relieved
                    I hear about their concept of "ideation" less and less,
                    because the phrase is otherwise like, only associated with
                    suicidal ideation for me. Listening to these guys, it
                    literally just sounded like they all just wanted to kill
                    themselves all the time.

                    I am aware that "reading about things" or "picking up a
